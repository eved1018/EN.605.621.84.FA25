    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will continue to explore the Maryland Lighthouse Challenge problem.  In PA 2, you implemented a brute-force solution to the problem.  This is guaranteed to get the optimal solution, but it was extremely slow to run-- this is a very large issue for any \"real world\" implementation, as the data sets for actual problems may well run to millions or even billions of data points.  So, we are going to explore some techniques that can possibly make these more tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore how we can trade memory space for processing time, using a technique called *memoization*.  (\"Memo\", as in, making a memorandum of something, rather than *memo**R**ization*).  As you may have noticed in the last assignment, a lot of the calculations are repeated many times.  For example, if we have a set of five lighthouses (A, B, C, D, E), then the best path through the set (A, B, C) will be calculated at least twice, as part of the larger possible paths D-> E->(A, B, C) and E-> D-> (A, B, C); and both times, the brute force algorithm will compute all 6 possible pathways through (A, B, C).  If we stored the partial results for (A, B, C) in memory, it would be possible to skip some of this computation.  So, in this assignment, your algorithm should save a copy of each calculation it makes, and then save that in memory; if the same calculation returns again, it should use the stored result rather than re-calculating it.  In other words, your program should recognize when L_minus = [A, B, C] has been calculated before, and fetch the optimum path (say, C-> A-> B) and optimum time (say, 5.78) from memory, rather than recursing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you should use the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. The contest requires a visit of all lighthouses; the winner is the first team to visit all lights (the contestants do not need to return to the start point).\n",
    "1. Teams may start at any lighthouse, and finish at any other lighthouse. \n",
    "1. Travel time from A to B is the same as the time from B to A. (Equivalently, the paths A->B->C and C->B->A are equal, and your algorithm is correct if it provides either one.  You do not need to provide both.)\n",
    "1. Several utility functions are provided for your use-- you may modify these as you see fit, or write your own.  Your fastest_tour_bf() program from PA 2 will be a utility function for you to use in this assignment, to compare to the performance of your memoized program.\n",
    "1. You may assume that, for step count purposes, a memory lookup is a single step.\n"

    "1. You should only use Python inbuilt data structures for this assignment (e.g. lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.)  *Hint:* Pay close attention to the rules on whether a Python data type is *mutable* (changeable) or *immutable* (not)-- remember that only *immutable* data items (like tuples) should be used as keys to dictionaries.\n",
    "1. You may not use Python libraries for combinatorics, sorting, permutations, combinations, or similar tools-- for example, you cannot use any function in Python's itertools library.  You need to build all logical structures that traverse the data set yourself, so that you can accurately measure the workload imposed by your algorithmic choices.\n",

You should explain what you tried to do, what did/did not work, and what you would do next if you had additional time.  **Important:  don't just turn in broken code, or graphs that don't match your analytic results!**  It's important to show that, if there was some problem, you recognized that there was an issue and what you were doing to resolve the disconnect.  Bugs and mistakes do happen, time does run out, but you need to show what you understand of the problem in order to get at least partial credit.  "
